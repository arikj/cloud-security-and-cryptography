While reading about cloud security, we found following two interesting problems :


a) Data Security in cloud:

1)Data transition takes place in encrypted form and data remains in encrypted form if required for simple storage.

2)But, since cloud service provides applications to allow users to process their data online, data need to be unencrypted.

Therefore, unless the data is in the cloud for only simple storage, the data will be unencrypted during at least part of its life cycle in the cloudâ€”processing at a minimum. This leads to confidentiality and integrity issues on private data.

Therefore, a secure and fully homomorphic encryption scheme is required to process data without decrypting it.
 
b) Data Integrity:

Integrity requires the use of message authentication codes (MACs).Customers need to check integrity of their data on cloud without downloading and reuploading of huge data, as it will be slow. 
A mathematical way to verify the integrity of the data as it is dynamically stored in the cloud is required.

We, need to learn about homomorphic encryption and data integrity in detail. Please tell us some reference for the same.
